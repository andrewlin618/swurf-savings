# Swurf Savings

A savings tool designed to help rideshare (Uber, DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub, etc.) workers achieve their savings goals. 

The end goal is for someone to be able to look at the site and see "How many shifts do I need to take to reach _____ savings goal."

#### The MVP features are:
 - Have payment details be updated using Plaid API
 - Allow users to create savings goals with 3 different tiers of importance based on what they prioritize. (This allows them to plan for long term savings goals as well as short term items that they might want to purchase)
 - Shows progress to each goal based on its priority
 - Is able to analyze income based on hours spent as well as what situations will allow them to earn more money (Ex. When I DoorDash, I might make more while delivering for 3 hours during Sunday Football as opposed to 3pm on a Wednesday)

 #### Stretch goals
